			Hello World!
		</h1>
		<p>
			I'm learning how to code. For instance, I just learned how to make the image below clickable. And now my text is blue and the title is turquoise thanks to css. The color code for it is 61C7B3 and it's the same as the ring on my finger. But now I've applied the "fancy" class to it, which overode my initial h1 settings.

				<li>and checking it twice</li>
			<p class="fancy">
			This is a fancy paragraph, to show just how good I'm getting at coding. So I'm making it another color, uppercase, centered, increasing the font and using Helvetica because it's more beautiful.</p>
